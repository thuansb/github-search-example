I understand that with this small project I just need to using React/React-router is enough but for proving that I have knowledge about: Redux, also some libraries like: Immutable, Reselect, Sagas and the good structure to handle a scalable react app.

For your information, I'm using the boilerplate: https://github.com/react-boilerplate to speed up the development progress.

The time commit on Github is not exactly how much time I spend for this demo because I'm not doing it continuously. The actual time is about: 5h.

Thanks.
